# Simple Color Conversion

## About

* Portable, simple, compact, written in pure C, two file color conversion library between color spaces, most notibly RGB -> CYM(K) and HSV

* I could not find a c library with all the color conversion functions I wanted, there are snippets here and there on the internet, but nothing licensed and on Github
* If you have anymore conversions you want added such as HSI, XYZ, YUV, YU'V'... SMPTE-C, Kodak YCC... let me know

## How to use

* Include color.c and color.h into your project
* Header file explains everything, it's very basic and simple to use
